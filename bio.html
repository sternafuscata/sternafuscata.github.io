        <h1>William Yancey Brown</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p>William Yancey Brown is a zoologist and lawyer with a career as a leader and advocate in government, non-profit organizations and the private sector focusing on science, education, and policy for a healthy, sustainable world. He has authored many non-fiction papers and two novels, <em>Valley of the Scorpion</em> and <em>Ruffner's Cave</em>.</p>

            <p>Dr. Brown was born in Artesia, California. He graduated from high school in Recife, Brazil, and graduated from the University of Virginia (B.A, Biology, 1969, with highest distinction), Johns Hopkins University (M.A.T., 1970), the University of Hawaii (Ph.D., Zoology, 1973), and Harvard Law School (J.D., 1977). He lives in Washington, DC, with his wife, Mary E. McLeod, and they have two daughters, Julia and Emma, and two grandsons, David and Michael.</p>

            <p>Dr. Brown was a National Science Foundation Fellow in the 1970s and studied the ecology of seabirds on Manana Island offshore of Oahu, Hawaii. He also taught anatomy and physiology laboratories. From 1973-74, he was Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. He went from there to Harvard Law School, and when in law school held summer and consulting positions with the Environmental Protection Agency (1974), Council on Environmental Quality (1975), and the Department of the Interior (1976-77).</p>

            <p>In 1977, Dr. Brown was appointed Executive Secretary of the federal Endangered Species Scientific Authority, which was responsible for U.S. scientific review of wildlife trade under the CITES Convention. He was also a member of the delegation that negotiated the Bonn Convention on Migratory Animals in 1979. In 1980, Dr. Brown was appointed Executive Secretary of the federal International Convention Advisory Commission, with similar responsibilities.</p>

            <p>Dr. Brown joined the Environmental Defense Fund in 1981 where he served as Senior Scientist and Acting Executive Director. At EDF, Dr. Brown was a national leader on endangered species, wetlands protection, and Antarctic conservation. He served on U.S. delegations to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the State Department Antarctic Advisory Committee. He represented EDF as an attorney of record in litigation that was settled and substantially enhanced wetlands protection under the Clean Water Act. He authored a report on tax policy and natural resource conservation. When Acting Executive Director of EDF for most of 1984, he focused on management and fundraising.</p>

            <p>In 1985, Dr. Brown took a position with Waste Management, Inc. He was at WMI for nine years, serving initially as Director of Government Affairs and later as Vice President for Environmental Planning and Programs. He was the first Chairman of the WMI Executive Environmental Committee. WMI was the world's largest waste management company with approximately 65,000 employees worldwide and annual revenues of $10 billion. At WMI, Dr. Brown was the architect of the company's comprehensive environmental policy and many programs for its implementation. These included measures and incentives for pollution prevention and management, legal compliance, and a unique program for no-net-loss of biological diversity on company properties. Dr. Brown initiated and supervised public disclosure of WMI environmental performance in annual environmental reports, and was the company's principal representative to the environmental community. He also led company legislative efforts on key environmental issues, including legislation eventually adopted as the Pollution Prevention Act and advocacy in support of the Endangered Species Act.</p>

            <p>Dr. Brown managed the company's environmental grant program, providing between $500,000 and $1,000,000 annually in grants to environmental organizations. He represented the company in the Environmental Grantmakers Association and the Council on Foundations. He played a leading role in establishing a WMI waste reduction business unit in 1986. He was intimately involved with policy and practice for site clean-up, recycling and disposal of municipal and hazardous waste, wastewater treatment, sludge and compost management, and trash-to-energy.</p>

            <p>Dr. Brown joined Hagler Bailly Consulting in 1994, where he was a principal and directed its international environmental programs. At Hagler Bailly, Dr. Brown supervised international projects undertaken by the firm for USAID, the Asian Development Bank, and private sector clients. Among other things, he negotiated a contract with the ADB for environmental assistance to Vietnam. He presented seminars in Egypt on environmental management for USAID. He provided advice to private sector clients on accessing public sector finance. He also managed an environmental audit of a company's waste site clean up activities.</p>

            <p>In March 1996, Dr. Brown affiliated with the World Wildlife Fund as a Senior Fellow, where he remained until appointment as the Science Advisor to the Secretary of the Interior. He advised the President of WWF on various management and fundraising issues and on ways to engage the corporate community in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

            <p>Dr. Brown was appointed the Science Advisor to Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt in April 1997. He advised the Secretary and provided leadership on diverse issues concerning science and policy at the Department, and he frequently addressed public forums. He led the Department's Science Board and oversaw USGS science support for the other Departmental bureaus. He also led science and policy initiatives on a range of issues including oceans and coral reefs, invasive species, and biotechnology. He wrote executive orders issued by President Clinton on coral reef protection and on invasive species, and he recruited and supervised the staff of the Invasive Species Council. He proposed and then oversaw work that culminated in the establishment of three national wildlife refuges with coral reefs and the Northwest Hawaiian Islands reserve, which has since been made a national monument and is the largest protected nature reserve in the United States. He left Interior in January 2001 at the end of the Clinton Administration, and joined the staff of the National Audubon Society as Vice President for Science Policy and Director of Audubon's Living Oceans Program. At Audubon, he supervised a group focusing on fisheries management, marine protected areas, and sustainable choices in seafood consumption, before being recruited to head the Bishop Museum.</p>

            <p>From October 2001 until January 2007, Dr. Brown was President and CEO of the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii. Bishop Museum was founded in 1889, and maintains the world's largest collection of Hawaiian and Pacific cultural and natural history objects. The museum employs over 200 staff and has an annual operating budget of about $15 million. During Dr. Brown's tenure, the museum's finances improved significantly, a new 19,000 ft&sup2; science education center was planned, paid for, and built, and a major renovation of historic buildings, now completed, was planned and most funds needed were raised. Among many accomplishments, he recruited a Chinese scholar to head the anthropology department, and with him established a research program in China. He launched work on climate adaptation in Melansia supported by the MacArthur Foundation. He negotiated and signed an MOU on cooperative activities with the President of French Polynesia. He also handled an incredibly controversial issue involving cultural artifacts that had been misappropriated from the museum before he became its President and that had been buried in a cave on the Big Island. He retrieved the artifacts under court order. He also led work with the museum board to successfully secure a Native Hawaii majority in its membership.</p>

            <p>From February 2007 until January 2010, Dr. Brown was President and CEO of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. The Academy was established in 1812 and is the oldest scientific research institution in the Americas, with vast collections, historic exhibits, and programs for research and education. It has an annual operating budget of approximately $14 million and over 200 staff. When at the Academy, Dr. Brown established an Asia Center and developed MOUs with several organizations in China and Russia. He established an Environmental Policy Center and secured funding for its work. That center became the leading venue in Philadelphia and environs for discussion and debate on environmental issues. He raised $500,000 from individuals and with that oversaw preparation of an innovative plan for renovations to the 236,000 ft&sup2; building and its exhibits.</p>

            <p>Dr. Brown was President and CEO of the Woods Hole Research Center from February 2010 until January 2011, when he resigned to move to Washington, DC, and join his wife, Mary McLeod, who was the Principal Deputy Legal Advisor at the Department of State. WHRC is a leading non-profit research organization applying science to global environmental challenges, including climate change and forest conservation. In his limited time at WHRC, Dr. Brown recruited a dynamic management team addressing finance and administration, development, and policy. He launched a strategic planning process. He also participated in the 15th and 16th Conferences of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen and Cancun.</p>

            <p>Dr. Brown was appointed a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution in June 2011, where he served as an expert and wrote papers in the areas of natural resource and biodiversity science, law and policy, and museum leadership.</p>

            <p>From November 2013 to June 2024, when he retired from federal service, Dr. Brown served as the Chief Environmental Officer of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in the Department of the Interior. BOEM studies and regulates oil, gas, renewable energy, and non-energy mineral development on the 3.2 million acres outer continental shelf of the United States. In this career SES position he oversaw environmental research, assessment and regulation for offshore energy and minerals production and supervised 60 staff and a $40 million annual budget. His work included an initiative that culminated in withdrawal by President Obama of the Atlantic Canyons from oil and gas development (over 3 million acres). He also established a scientific advisory relationship with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, the only one of its kind within the Interior Department, and developed with it a strategic framework for BOEM's research program.</p>

            <p>In October 2024, after retirement from BOEM, he was appointed a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council where he has written about ocean energy, seabed mining, and the use of AI for project reviews and development in Africa.</p>
